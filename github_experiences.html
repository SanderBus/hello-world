                <b>Branch</b> - Making a copy of the repository (which still lives in that repository), such that one can make changes without affecting the original, which lives in the master branch. You can merge the copy bakc into the master branch when you are happy with the changes.<br>
                <b>Clone</b> - Copy of a repository on your local machine.<br>
                <b>Commit</b> - Saves the file(s) you worked on, including a log message. Each commit gets a unique ID(hash or SHA), such that older versions of the code can be recovered.<br>
                <b>Push</b> - Act of pushing an updated file from your local machine to github.<br>
                <b>Repository</b> - Project folder, this is what github is about. It not only saves files with code, but also documentation and revision history. Multiple people can work on one project.<br>
